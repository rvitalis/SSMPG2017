The pseudo-observed data in the file 'run-example/calibration/pod_data.dat' were simulated using the posterior means of the model parameters, from the analysis of the following dataset:

A total of 2000 loci were simulated. To that end, the posterior means of the pi parameters were sampled with replacement from the 2249 loci of the original data.
